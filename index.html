            <p>Hello explorer! I recently discovered an issue as polarizing as marmiteâ€”the humble samosa.</p>
            <p>Turns out many are strongly against messing with the formula (if it ain't broke and all that).</p>
            <p>With the deepest respect for the sanctity of samosas, and for the incurably curious, I give you APPLE SAMOSA!!!</p>

            <div class="ingredients">
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cooking apples, peeled, cored, and chopped</li>
                    <li>50g caster sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp ground mixed spice</li>
                    <li>50g sultanas (optional)</li>
                    <li>4 sheets filo pastry</li>
                    <li>25g low-fat spread (e.g., Flora Light), melted</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="method">
                <h3>Method:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the apples, sugar, mixed spice, and sultanas in a saucepan with 2 tbsp water and cook, covered, for 6 minutes or until the apples are soft, stirring once or twice. Spread the mixture out to cool slightly.</li>
                    <li>Cut the sheets of filo into thirds lengthways, then brush lightly with the melted spread. Place a spoonful of the apple filling at the top of each strip, then fold over and over to form triangular parcels.</li>
                    <li>Place on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes until crisp and golden. Serve with low-fat yogurt, if you like.</li>
                </ol>
