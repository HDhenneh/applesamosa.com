<h2>Apple Samosa Recipe</h2>
<p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cooking apples, peeled, cored and chopped</li>
  <li>50g caster sugar</li>
  <li>1 tsp ground mixed spice</li>
  <li>50g sultanas (not a fan!)</li>
  <li>4 sheets filo pastry</li>
  <li>25g low-fat spread (we used Flora Light), melted</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Method:</h3>
  <p>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the apples, sugar, mixed spice and sultanas in a saucepan with 2 tbsp water and cook, covered,
     for 6 mins or until the apples are soft, stirring once or twice. Tip into a shallow dish and spread out to cool slightly.</p>
     <p>Cut the sheets of filo in thirds lengthways, then brush lightly with the melted spread.
       Place a spoonful of the apple filling at the top of each strip,then fold over and over to form triangular parcels.
       Place on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 mins until crisp and golden. Serve with low-fat yogurt, if you like.</p>
